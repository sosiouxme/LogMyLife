*** Development underway, but not in a useful state yet ***

Eclipse project for an Android application. You'll probably need Eclipse
and the Android SDK and ADT plugin to make sense of it. The code is
licensed under the GPLv3 (see LICENSE file).

WhenDidI helps with cyclical events and tasks by:
* Logging when an item (event or task) was performed
* Alerting when an item has not been performed for a specified period.
* Hopefully soon, serving as input to a website for the same purpose
  but with greater abilities like graphical log analysis.

Perhaps it will merge later with a more generic task/calendar app, not sure.

Examples of use cases:
* How long has it been since I watered the plants?
* When did I last change the filters on my furnace?
* When did I get an oil change for my car?
* Reminder to call home every so often.
* When was my (or her) last period?
* How often have we eaten out in the last month?
