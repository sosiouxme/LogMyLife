Use this page to create a tracker which will contain
the logs for a single event (e.g. getting a
haircut, exercising, calling Mom).
</p><p>
A tracker only needs a name in order to be created (the "Save" button
is inactive until you specify one). You may also choose to
add:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Notes</b> clarifying what the tracker is for
</li><li>A <b>label</b> for values that you record with log entries
</li><li><b>Alerts</b> to remind you when time has passed since logging an entry
</li></ul>
<p>
You can save the tracker when you're ready by hitting the "Save" button
or the back button. Use the "Cancel" button to cancel tracker creation.
