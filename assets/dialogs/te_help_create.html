<p>
This screen is for creating a tracker to name what you are logging (e.g. getting a
haircut, exercising, calling Mom). Trackers can
be for events that occur, tasks you perform, or anything recurring in general that you
want to keep track of.
</p>
<ul><li>
<b>Group: </b> You can choose a different group for the tracker by changing this. 
Also, when you return to the main screen, this is the tracker group you'll see.
</li><li>
<b>Name: </b> This is what shows up in the list of trackers on the main screen.
Make it a good summary of what you're tracking.
</li><li>
<b>Notes: </b> Optional further description of what it is you're keeping track of.
</li><li>
<b>Value: </b> Optional label for the option value you can record with log entries
for later use in graphs and summaries.
</li><li>
<b>Reminders: </b> You can optionally have LogMyLife remind you when an interval of time
has passed since the last log entry. This can be helpful to remind you to do something
or take note of a gap between occurrences. You can configure multiple reminders with different
intervals.
</li></ul>
<p>
A tracker only needs a name in order to be created (the "Save" button
is inactive until you specify one).
</p><p>
If you press the back button, the tracker is saved just as if you had pressed "Save".
You must use the "Cancel" button to cancel creation.</p>
