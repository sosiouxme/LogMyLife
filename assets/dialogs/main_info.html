<p>
<b>LogMyLife</b> is an application to help you track
recurring events and (optionally) remind you when too much 
time has passed since the last occurrence.
</p><p>
Use the menu button on most screens for extra options.
Also, most lists have extra long-click options.
</p><p>
<b>This is an alpha release! Expect broken stuff!</b>
And please create issues for problem reports and requests
(see below).
</p>
<h2>Usage: the main screen</h2>
<p>
This main screen shows a list of trackers you can
define in order to track events. Once you have
created a tracker, you can log entries to it.
</p><p>
Trackers may be organized into groups, e.g. "Household",
"Personal", etc. The group is displayed and chosen
at the top of this screen. You may create and edit
groups by pressing the Menu button and selecting
"Groups".
</p>
<h2>Liberate your data</h2>
<p>
All of the data you enter in this application can be exported to the SD card
in order to be imported into another LogMyLife installation. To do this, press the
Menu button and select "Data".
</p><p>
Future versions of LogMyLife should also be able to synchronize data to a website,
as well as providing it in spreadsheet-readable format.
</p>
