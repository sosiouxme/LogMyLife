<b>LogMyLife</b> is an application to help you track
recurring events and (optionally) remind you when too much 
time has passed since the last occurrence.
</p>
<h2>Usage: the main screen</h2>
<p>
Use the menu button on most screens for extra options.
Also, most lists have extra long-click options.
</p><p>
This main screen shows a list of trackers you can
define in order to track events. Once you have
created a tracker, you can log entries to it.
</p><p>
Trackers may be organized into groups, e.g. "Household",
"Personal", etc. The group is displayed and chosen
at the top of this screen.
