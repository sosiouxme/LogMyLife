On this screen you can specify the information for a single log entry. 
The top of the screen shows some information about the tracker against which
you are logging. Below that you may specify:
</p>
<ul><li>
<b>Date and Time:</b> touch these buttons to modify when the log event happened.
</li><li>
<b>Notes:</b> optionally specify anything you want to remember about the event.
</li><li>
<b>Value:</b> optionally specify a numerical value related to the event (for
the purpose of graphing/analysis later).
</li></ul>
<p>
You can always edit the log entry after creating it.
</p><p>
If you press the back button, the log entry is saved when you return
to the tracker just as if you had pressed "Save". You must use the
"Cancel" button to cancel the creation or modification of the entry.
