This <b>groups</b> screen is for editing the groups you use to
organize your trackers. Each tracker belongs to one group. You can
add more groups with the "Add new group" button at the top of the
list or from the "New group" menu item.

You can edit a group's name or delete the group from the context
menu (long-press the name). Simply pressing the group name will return
to the main screen with this group's trackers displayed.
