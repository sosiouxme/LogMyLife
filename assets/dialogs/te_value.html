A numeric value can be recorded with each log entry for your records. You might
use this to record e.g.</p>
<ul><li>How many repetitions of an exercise you did.
</li><li>How much of a medication you took.
</li><li>How much dinner cost.
</li></ul>
<p>
It is up to you to use this if and how you want to. In the future, you should be able to
use this data to build graphs or charts to observe trends.
