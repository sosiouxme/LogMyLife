<p>
A numeric value can be recorded with each log entry for your records. You might
use this to record e.g.</p>
<ul><li>How many repetitions of an exercise you did.
</li><li>How much of a medication you took.
</li><li>How much dinner cost.
</li></ul>
<p>
It is up to you to use this if and how you want to. In the future, you should be able to
use this data to build graphs or charts to observe trends.
</p><p>
If you want to record a value with your log entries, check the box. Values
may be of several types; this influences how the value is entered when you create
an entry, and how it is displayed in the entry listing.
</p><p>
You can also choose a label for the value which will be displayed 
with the value for log entries for this tracker.
